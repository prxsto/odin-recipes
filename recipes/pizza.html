  <p>Detroit-style pizza is a style of pizza developed in Detroit, Michigan. It is a rectangular pizza that has a thick
    crisp crust and toppings such as pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust of a Detroit-style pizza is occasionally
    twice-baked and it is usually baked in rectangular steel trays that were originally made to hold small industrial
    parts in factories. The style first began at Buddy's Rendezvous Pizzeria in 1946, and was popularized by the Buddy's
    chain.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 3/4 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups water</li>
    <li>8 ounces whole milk mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
    <li>8 ounces pepperoni, sliced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Mix in the oil and water. Knead the dough until it forms a
      smooth ball. If the dough is too sticky, add additional flour until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If
      the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured
      surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.</li>
    <li>Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap
      and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
      surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Place each piece of dough in a separate bowl, cover with a clean
      kitchen towel and let them rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F (290 degrees C). Press each piece of dough into a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
    <li>Top the dough with mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the cheese has melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
