  <p>Cornbread is a generic name for any number of quick breads containing cornmeal. They are usually leavened by baking
    powder. The cornmeal gives them a characteristically gritty texture. Cornbread is a common bread in United States
    cuisine, particularly associated with the South and Southwest, as well as being a traditional staple for populations
    where wheat flour was more expensive.</p>
