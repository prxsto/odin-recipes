  <!-- <h1>Description</h1> -->
  <p>Macaroni and cheese—also called mac 'n' cheese in the US, macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom—is a dish of
    English origin, consisting of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also
    incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs, meat and vegetables.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8 ounces (1/2 pound or about 1 3/4 cups) macaroni or other medium tubular pasta, like fusilli, campanelle, or
      penne</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika, optional</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups 1% milk</li>
    <li>3 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese, about 12 ounces</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Boil the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally,
      until the pasta is al dente—firm to the bite. Drain in a colander and set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, salt, pepper, dry mustard, and paprika
      (if using) and keep it moving for about 2 minutes, making sure it's free of lumps.</li>
    <li>Stir in the milk: Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly, and continue to cook and stir until the sauce is
      bubbling and thickened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the cheese: Turn the heat off and gently stir in the cheese until it is melted and the sauce is smooth. If
      the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk. Taste and add more seasonings if you like.</li>
    <li>Combine the pasta and cheese sauce: In a large serving bowl, combine the sauce and the pasta, stirring to coat
      the
      pasta well. Serve immediately.</li>
